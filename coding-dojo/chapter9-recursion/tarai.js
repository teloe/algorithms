/*
 * The tarai (Japanese: “to pass around”) function was created to profile
 * recursive performance in various systems and languages. Unlike other
 * functions, numbers don't get particularly large, but the amount of recursion
 * is significant. The tarai function accepts three parameters, and is defined
 * as:
 *
 * 1) tarai(x,y,z) == y , if x <= y (otherwise see rule #2);
 *
 * 2) tarai(x,y,z) == tarai(tarai(x-1,y,z),tarai(y-1,z,x),tarai(z-1,x,y)) .
 *
 * Calling tarai(10,2,9) should return 9 (after recursing 4145 times!).
